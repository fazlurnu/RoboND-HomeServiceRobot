# RoboND-HomeServiceRobot

Project 5 of Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree

## Overview  
In this project, you will use everything you learned in the Nanodegree Program to build a Home Service Robot in ROS.  
### Mapping  
You will create a `test_slam.sh` script file and launch it to manually test SLAM.  
A functional map of the environment should be created which would be used for localization and navigation tasks.  
### Localization and Navigation  
You will create a `test_navigation.sh` script file to launch it for manual navigation test.  
Your robot should be able to navigate in the environment after a 2D Nav Goal command is issued.  
You will create a `pick_objects.sh` file that will send multiple goals for the robot to reach.  
The robot travels to the desired pickup zone, displays a message that it reached its destination, waits 5 seconds, travels to the desired drop off zone, and displays a message that it reached the drop off zone."  
### Home Service Functions  
You will create a `add_marker.sh` file that will publish a marker to rviz.  
The marker should initially be published at the pickup zone. After 5 seconds it should be hidden. Then after another 5 seconds it should appear at the drop off zone.
The student should write a home_service.sh file that will run all the nodes in this project.  
The student's home service robot should be simulated as follow:  
* Initially show the marker at the pickup zone.
* Hide the marker once your robot reach the pickup zone.
* Wait 5 seconds to simulate a pickup.
* Show the marker at the drop off zone once your robot reaches it.


## Prerequisites/Dependencies  
* Gazebo >= 7.0  
* ROS Kinetic  
* ROS Packages
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-navigation
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-map-server
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-move-base
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-amcl
```

* make >= 4.1(mac, linux), 3.81(Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)


## Setup Instructions
1. Meet the `Prerequisites/Dependencies`  
2. Open Ubuntu Bash and clone the project repository  
3. On the command line and execute  
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```
4. On the command line and execute  
```
mkdir -p /home/workspace/catkin_ws/src
cd catkin_ws/src  
catkin_init_workspace
git clone https://github.com/fazlurnu/RoboND-HomeServiceRobot.git
```
5. Build and run your code.  

## Run the project  
* Open the repository, make and source  
```
cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```
